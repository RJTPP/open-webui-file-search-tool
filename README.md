# üìÇ File Search Tool

An interactive [OpenWebUI](https://openwebui.com/t/rjtpp/file_search_tool) plugin for searching, reading, and navigating files directly from the UI ‚Äî with optional regex filtering, status reporting, recursion depth control, and more.

## ‚ú® Features

- üìÅ List files in a directory with pagination, sorting, and hidden file support
- üîç Search filenames using one or multiple **regex patterns** (with BFS or DFS traversal)
- üß† Read full file content or extract matching lines with **context windows**
- üß≠ Navigate the filesystem (change and retrieve working directory)
- üîé Identify path types (file, directory, symbolic link, or excluded/missing)
- ‚è±Ô∏è Enforce time limits and depth limits during search operations

| `get_path_type(paths)`    | Show the type of each path (file, dir, symlink)                             |
| `get_exclude_paths()`     | Returns configured exclude paths from `Valves`                              |
| `read_file(file_paths)`   | Read content from plain text files                                          |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Notice

This tool provides direct access to your local filesystem, including the ability to read and traverse files recursively.

- It is strongly recommended to use this tool for **local, personal, or trusted environments only**.
- Avoid exposing the tool over public networks without strict access controls.
- Use the `EXCLUDE_PATHS` configuration to restrict access to sensitive directories such as `/home/user`, `/Users`, `/etc`, or cloud-synced locations.

This tool is not hardened for sandboxed or multi-user environments.
